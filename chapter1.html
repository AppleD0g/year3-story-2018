<head> Snow White and Seven Dwarfs</head>

<p>
<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a lovely princess with fair skin and blue eyes.
She was so fair that she was named Snow White. Her mother died when Snow White was a baby and her father married again.
This queen was very pretty but she was also very cruel. The wicked stepmother wanted to be the most beautiful lady in the kingdom and she would often ask her magic mirror,
It was in the middle of winter, when snow was falling around, that a certain queen sat working at her window, the frame of which was made of fine black ebony; and, as she was looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it.

'Mirror! Mirror on the wall! Who is the fairest of them all?' And the magic mirror would say, 'You are, Your Majesty!' But one day, the mirror replied,

'Snow White is the fairest of them all!' The wicked queen was very angry and jealous of Snow White. She ordered her huntsman to take Snow White to the forest and kill her.
'I want you to bring back her heart,' she ordered. But when the huntsman reached the forest with Snow White, he took pity on her and set her free.
He killed a deer and took its heart to the wicked Step Mother and told her that he had killed Snow White. Snow White wandered in the forest all night, crying.

Then poor Snow-White wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared around, but none did her any harm.
In the evening she came to a little cottage, and went in there to rest, for her weary feet would carry her no further.
