She cooked a wonderful meal and cleaned the house and tired, finally slept on one of the tiny beds.
At night, the seven dwarfs who lived in the cottage came home and found Snow White sleeping.
When she woke up and told them her story, the seven dwarfs asked her to stay with them. When the dwarfs were away, Snow White would make delicious meals for them.
The dwarfs loved her and cared for her.

Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains; and Snow-White remained at home.

Every morning, when they left the house, they instructed her never to open the door to strangers.
Meanwhile, in the palace, the wicked queen asked, 'Mirror! Mirror on the Who is the fairest of them'

The mirror replied,' White is the fairest of them all! She lives with the seven dwarfs in the woods!'
