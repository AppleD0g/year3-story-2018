<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

Then she disguised herself as an old peasant woman and went to the woods with the apple. She knocked on the cottage door and said 'Pretty little child!
Let me in! Look what I have for you!' White said, 'I am so sorry, old lady, I cannot let you in! The seven dwarfs have told me not to talk to strangers!'

But then, Snow White saw the shiny red apple, and opened the door. The wicked witch offered her the apple and when she took a bite poor Snow White fell into a deep sleep.
The wicked stepmother went back to the palace and asked the mirror, 'Mirror! Mirror on the wall! Who is the fairest of them all?'
The mirror replied, 'You are, Your Majesty!' and she was very happy.

When the seven dwarfs came home to find Snow White lying on the floor, they were very upset.
They cried all night and then built a glass coffin for Snow White. They kept the coffin in front of the cottage.


And so Snow-White lay there for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she were asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snow-White and read what was written in golden letters.
Then he offered the dwarfs money, and earnestly begged them to let him take her away; but they said, 'We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.' At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snow-White awoke, and exclaimed, 'Where am I?'

Immediately, Snow White opened her eyes. She was alive again! The Prince and the seven dwarfs were very happy.
When she heard this, the queen started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride.
And when she arrived, and saw that it was no other than Snow-White, whom she thought had been dead a long while, she choked with passion, and fell ill and died;
but Snow-White and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land, many, many years.
