Then she disguised herself as an old peasant woman and went to the woods with the apple. She knocked on the cottage door and said 'Pretty little child!
Let me in! Look what I have for you!' White said, 'I am so sorry, old lady, I cannot let you in! The seven dwarfs have told me not to talk to strangers!'

But then, Snow White saw the shiny red apple, and opened the door. The wicked witch offered her the apple and when she took a bite poor Snow White fell into a deep sleep.
The wicked stepmother went back to the palace and asked the mirror, 'Mirror! Mirror on the wall! Who is the fairest of them all?'
The mirror replied, 'You are, Your Majesty!' and she was very happy.

When the seven dwarfs came home to find Snow White lying on the floor, they were very upset.
They cried all night and then built a glass coffin for Snow White. They kept the coffin in front of the cottage.
One day, Prince Charming was going past the cottage and he saw Snow White lying in the coffin.
He said to the dwarfs, 'My! My! She is so beautiful! I would like to kiss her!' And he did.

Immediately, Snow White opened her eyes. She was alive again! The Prince and the seven dwarfs were very happy.
Prince Charming married Snow White and took her to his palace and lived happily ever after.

Nobody knows if wicked stepmother know what Snow White is still alive or not....
